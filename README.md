##  Introduction
In this project, we analyze a dataset of recipes and their ratings to explore what factors contribute to higher ratings. Specifically, we aim to predict recipe ratings based on features such as the number of ingredients, preparation time, number of steps, and nutritional content. This matters because we think that recipe ratings influence what people cook and how they choose recipes online. Understanding which factors correlate with higher ratings can help recipe creators optimize their content and improve user experience on food platforms.
